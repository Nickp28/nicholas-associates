            <p>Mike and his crew renovated our basement bathroom and laundry room in 2015. They built a full bathroom including brand new plumbing and a new laundry room. Their work in the basement was beautiful, came in at budget, and stood the test of time, so we had them back for our kitchen and upstairs bathroom in early 2019 to finish all of the major renovations in our 1952 townhouse. Communication with Mike and Davis was great, we always knew what to expect which was crucial for such a large project. Their crew is respectful, taking off their shoes and sweeping up everyday, covering furniture, etc. They are proud of their work and it shows. We love our new kitchen and bathroom! We highly recommend Nicholas and Associates!""</p>

              <p>&apos;ve previously used Nicholas &amp; Associates (N&amp;A) for a bathroom remodel (2016) and this time (March 2018) for a complete kitchen remodel &amp; master shower renovation. The contractor&apos;s site visit was comprehensive and practical without any pressure to increase costs above my budget range. I was provided recommendations on where to save and where to invest money to get the most from my remodel. From start to finish, N&amp;A&apos;s team inspired complete confidence. They completed the project ahead of schedule and below the estimated cost. Workmanship, Electrical, plumbing, walls, tile, lighting, appliance installation were all done to exacting standards and no re-work! Employees were on time, professional, courteous, and cleaned up after themselves every day. My friends and neighbors were amazed at the high quality of this. This¬ù renovation has significantly increased the value of my home. Call Nicholas &amp; Associates for exceptional work at a better price!</p>

                  <p>To characterize Mike&apos;s initial site visit, he was the most practical &amp; down-to-earth of all the consultants that we interviewed. He actually listened! During our meeting, he gave us cost saving ideas and guided us on where we should shell out more money to get the most out of the bathroom remodel. When we hired Nicholas &amp; Associates, the whole team inspired confidence: Employees -- Professional, courteous, hardworking &amp; cleaned up after themselves at the end of each day. Outstanding! Schedule -- Completed the work on time as I expected. No surprises. Cost -- Estimated labor cost vs. Actual was spot on. Again, no surprises. This was our first experience with Nicholas &amp; Associates and we will be using them again. Finding an honest and reliable home contractor team is a rarity and Mike makes the grade.</p>

                          <p>This company is top notch. I would recommend to everyone. First impression prior to hiring was that Mike Nicholson really cared about giving us the most for the limited amount of funds to work with. Going with many of his recommendations, outcome has been great, thus far. and I have not one complaint. My project was water damage and involved drywall, paint, flooring, tile, kitchen. You can&apos;t go wrong with this company.</p>

They went above and beyond and literally helped to save the day.

They did what they said they would, and more, all with a smile. Aces.</p>
